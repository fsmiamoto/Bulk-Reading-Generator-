## How to Use

* Once you installed the add-on either by using Anki's built-in downloader or by saving the .py file to your add-on folder, a option called
'Reading Generator' should appear in your tool's menu.

* By clicking on it, a window should pop up.

* You can select the deck you want and then insert the source and destinations fields (e.g Expression and Reading)

* After that, just click OK and it should be done!

## Additional Info

* This add-on is still under development so some bug's / errors can be expected.
* Please check your input carefully since the add-on does not do that by now.
* The add-on only generates readings for the cards that don't already have it so it will not overwrite previous reading generations
